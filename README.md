# The Infinite Lyricist

A CSC-475 at the University of Victoria project by Andrew Hobden, Brody Holden, and Pascale Mendes.

This is a work in progress. Full instructions will follow.

## Prerequisites

You must be using Python 2.7 (Not 3.0) and have a valid Marsyas installation with Swig bindings enabled in the build.

Then you can just run `./infinite-lyricist vocal.mp3 instrumental.mp3`

## Developing

There is a `marsystems` folder containing a relevant Marsyas systems. See the `marsyas_helper.py` file for a helper function to invoke them. Feel encouraged to expand this.
