This is a quick-and-dirty instrumental rock song by Brody Holden. The song
has bass, guitar, synth, and drum tracks.

The song.tg file is a 'TuxGuitar' file. WAV files of all combinations of
instruments in this song where created to allow testing the key and bmp
detection and the project as a whole.

The combinations where created by:
    - In TuxGuitar, setting the volume of instruments to be excluded to zero in
      the mixer menu (View->Show Mixer, or Control+m).
    - In TuxGuitar, export as midi (File>Export>Export Midi). Save the file in
      the midi/ directory.
    - Via the command line, enter:
        $ cd instrumentals/
        $ ./midi2wav.sh
      The wav files are now in the wav/ directory.

Artistic note:
    The 'D A' part sound better as 'D Am' but it was left 'D A' to keep the
    track simple.

The resulting WAV files where run through https://www.audiokeychain.com/ and the
following keys and BMPs where detected:
